### cm005 2015-09-22 Tuesday overview

  * You should submit [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html) today!
    - Show me that you've worked through [your Git + GitHub + RStudio agony](git00_index.html).
    - Get help in class [office hours](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/85) if you're struggling.
  * Peer review will be set in motion soon via Issues. I'll announce via [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues) so you'll know when to look for notification.
  * [Homework 02](hw02_explore-gapminder-use-rmarkdown.html) due before class next Tuesday 2015-09-29.
  * Today
    - Introduction to `ggplot2`
    - (we return to `ggplot2` again in a couple weeks)
  * R Markdown, maybe? [Test drive R Markdown](block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html)
  * Or start to talk about [the many different flavors of R objects](block004_basic-r-objects.html)?
  * Next week we begin serious [data.frame wrangling with `dplyr`](block009_dplyr-intro.html).
  * Link to some enrollment data we could try to plot
    - [2015_stat545_enrollment-csv](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/924fe242a31e0239762f#file-2015_stat545_enrollment-csv)

#### Links

All the material for a tutorial I give on `ggplot2` is on Github:

  * <https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial>
  
[ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387981403/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=ggplot2-20), the `ggplot2` book by Hadley Wickham. Hadley and Carson Sievert are working on a new edition. You can watch the whole process and get all the content from GitHub:
  
 * <https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book>
 * The [companion website](http://ggplot2.org/book/) for the existing edition offers one R script per chapter, providing the code used in the book.

[`ggplot2` online docs](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)

[`ggplot2` "homepage"](http://ggplot2.org)

[`ggplot2` package development on github](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2) 

[The R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do), an excellent book by Winston Chang. *I really really love this book.*

- The [graphs section](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) of Winston Chang's website Cookbook for R. The book listed above contains much more material, but the website is good too.

A [`ggplot2` tutorial](http://stcorp.nl/R_course/tutorial_ggplot2.html) by Paul Hiemstra, one of [many excellent R courses](http://stcorp.nl/R_course/) he offers.

[A quick introduction to ggplot2](http://inundata.org/2013/04/10/a-quick-introduction-to-ggplot2/) by Karthik Ram. Slides and code from a 2 hour talk/hands on presentation for ggplot2 beginners.

Why do I teach `ggplot2`? Shouldn't beginners see "base" graphics first? I think not. David Robinson explains it well in [Don't teach built-in plotting to beginners (teach ggplot2)](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/).

Zev Ross has a lovely blog post: [Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/)

#### For R novices

You should have finished working through these by now:

  * [R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects](block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html)
  * [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block006_care-feeding-data.html)

You should be looking at this, so that you can ask questions when we cover in class (soon):

  * [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html)
