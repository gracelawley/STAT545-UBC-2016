### cm013 2015-10-20 Tuesday overview

This is the last normal class meeting before the STAT 545 --> STAT 547 transition (Thursday is guest lecture from Tamara Munzner).

HW update:

  * HW02 marks have been sent out.
  * HW03 marking underway. We've put 3 TAs on this to do it faster.
  * HW04 peer review open. Finish that sometime tomorrow, Wednesday.
  * HW05 will be the last homework of 545. It will be a revised mashup of 2014 HW05 + HW06. ~~Proposed due date: Monday October 26.~~ It is posted [here](hw05_factor-figure-boss-repo-hygiene.html) and is due Wednesday 2015-10-28.
  
We revisit a variety of practical figure-making topics. Will pick from here:

  * [Do's and don'ts of making effective graphs](block015_graph-dos-donts.html)
  * [R Graph Catalog](http://shiny.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/), a visual, clickable index of 100+ figures + `ggplot2` code to make them
  * [Using colors in R](block018_colors.html)
  * [Taking control of qualitative colors in ggplot2`](block019_enforce-color-scheme.html)
  * [Secrets of a happy graphing life](block016_secrets-happy-graphing.html)
  * [Writing figures to file](block017_write-figure-to-file.html)
  * [Multiple plots on a page](block020_multiple-plots-on-a-page.html)
