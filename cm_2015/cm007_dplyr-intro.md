  * Homework
    - HW01: marking underway
    - HW02: we expect you to submit today; I'll assign peer review issues tonight
    - HW03: will be due Tuesday 2015-10-06; here's how it looked last year but give me a chance to refresh -- [Homework 3](hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html)
  * Hello `dplyr`!
    - Part 1: [Introduction to dplyr](block009_dplyr-intro.html)
    - Part 2: [`dplyr` functions for a single dataset](block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html)
  * Not sure I'll get to it today, but you're going to need this stuff soon. Feel free to start it on your own:
    - [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html)
  * What's coming? we'll gradually move into this:
    - Functions, split-apply-combine
    - Tidy data
