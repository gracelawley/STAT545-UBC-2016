### cm004 2015-09-17 Thursday overview

  * Expect an email re: invitation to join the [STAT 545 Organization](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC) and then expect to be granted your own private repository ... ~~um, before you wake up tomorrow?~~ ok that took a little longer than I planned but it's DONE NOW.
  * All about R and data today
    - DATA!! You get to touch some!
    - Exploring a Gapminder excerpt
    - `data.frame`
    - sneak peek `ggplot2`
  * Indicative of what we will do together hands-on
    -  [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block006_care-feeding-data.html)
  * Homework 01 will be due before class Tuesday 2014-09-22
    -  [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html): Create a basic (R?) Markdown document and post it to GitHub.
    - Read the [General Homework Guidelines](hw00_homework-guidelines.html) for instructions on submission mechanics
  * What's next week?
    - Tuesday we might return to Git(Hub) and (R) Markdown, now that [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html) has gotten your attention.
    - Then we'll start `ggplot2` in earnest.
