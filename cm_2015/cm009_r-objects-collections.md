### cm009 2015-10-05 Tuesday overview

  * Homework
    - HW01: marking done. I'm sorting out a technical difficulty re: bulk emailing.
    - HW02: Peer review done. TA marking underway.
    - HW03: Due sometime today. Peer review will be set in motion this evening.
    - HW04: Will be due ... Tuesday October 13 *at the earliest* but likely later that week. Due to the Thanksgiving holiday and the way the topics are unfolding. I still want it to be about writing functions and split-apply-combine, but we may need a bit more time. Here's the [2014 version](hw04_write-function-use-plyr.html) but I might not do `plyr` this year.
  * Data life is not all rainbows and data.frames, so today we talk about R data structures.
    - [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html)
  * Maybe we will even start to look at writing functions today?
    - [Write your own R functions, part 1](block011_write-your-own-function-01.html)
  * What's coming?
    - more `dplyr`: split-apply-combine, joins
    - more writing your own functions
    - tidy data

#### Slides and links

I will show some slides and put them here.
