### cm103 2015-11-03 Tuesday overview

  * [HW07](hw07_data-wrangling-candy.html) due ~~Wednesday November 11~~ Friday November 13
    - Bring the Candy Survey data -- or part of it -- to a ready-to-analyze state and do basic exploration.
    - It is vital that you **finish some task**, nachos to cheesecake. We want a bit of story, some tables, some figures. Keep scaling back the cleaning and reshaping until you can manage this. Then scale up til you run out of time or patience.
    - ~~We might add an optional regex exercise.~~
    
  * The candy survey data is available:
    - on GitHub: <https://github.com/jennybc/candy>
    - look in [data-raw](https://github.com/jennybc/candy/tree/master/data-raw)
    - specifically [data-raw/00_explore-raw.R](https://github.com/jennybc/candy/blob/master/data-raw/00_explore-raw.R) will get you started and poses some challenges

   * [An introduction to data cleaning with R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/de_Jonge+van_der_Loo-Introduction_to_data_cleaning_with_R.pdf), a PDF based on a tutorial given by Edwin de Jonge and Mark van der Loo at the useR!2013 conference.
   * [Excel and delimited files](http://www.slideshare.net/jenniferbryan5811/excel-readwritedelimfiles), a whopping two pages by JB on writing plain text delimited files from Excel. Writing a delimited file from Excel is often the first step in data cleaning, but some people are mysteriously reluctant to do this. Here's how!
