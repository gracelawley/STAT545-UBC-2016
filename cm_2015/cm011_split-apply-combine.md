### cm011 2015-10-13 Tuesday overview

  * [HW04](hw04_write-function-split-apply-combine.html) will be due ?? sometime Friday 2015-10-16 ??. Write a function, documenting process from interactive pilot to formal tests. Apply function to Gapminder using `dplyr` or, maybe, `plyr`. Invitation to experiment with `broom` and then do more split-apply-combine or visualization on the results.
  * Writing your own functions. You should have finished this on your own.
    - [Write your own R functions, part 1](block011_write-your-own-function-01.html)
    - [Write your own R functions, part 2](block011_write-your-own-function-02.html)
    - [Write your own R functions, part 3](block011_write-your-own-function-03.html)
  * Data aggregation
    - Big picture slides linked and embedded below
    - [Guided challenge](block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html): write function to regress life expectancy on year and return the estimated intercept and slope
    - [Use `dplyr::do()`](block023_dplyr-do.html) to apply this function to each country in Gapminder; use `broom` to do same in a slick way to linear models in general
    - [Use `plyr::ddply()`](block013_plyr-ddply.html) to apply this function to each country in Gapminder *2014 material I'm keeping around and linked, just in case*
  * What's left for 545?
    - Tidy data and reshaping
    - Be the boss of your factors
    - Back to figs: practical matters (e.g. color and file management), guest lecture from Tamara Munzner
