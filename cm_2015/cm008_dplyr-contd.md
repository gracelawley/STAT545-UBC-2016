### cm008 2015-10-01 Thursday overview

  * Homework
    - HW01: marking almost done. We will email you a mark for your HW and your peer reviews. Assuming you gave me a valid email address in the survey.... Hmmm, are you better at typing email addresses than GitHub usernames? We'll see!
    - HW02: Peer review underway. Try to do that today. Marking will start almost immediately -- we want the feedback cycle to be faster.
    - HW03: will be due Tuesday 2015-10-06; here's how it looked last year but give me a chance to refresh -- [Homework 3](hw03_dplyr-and-more-ggplot2.html)
  * Hello `dplyr`!
    - Part 1: [Introduction to dplyr](block009_dplyr-intro.html) *did this Tuesday*
    - Part 2: [`dplyr` functions for a single dataset](block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html) *doing this today*
  * Data life is not all rainbows and data.frames, so we need to talk about R data structures.
    - [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block004_basic-r-objects.html) *doing some of this today, finish on your own and ask me if you want more!*
  * What's coming?
    - more `dplyr`
    - Functions, split-apply-combine operations in general
    - Tidy data
