__Visualization Analysis and Design__  
Guest lecture from [Tamara Munzner](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/)

Computer-based visualization systems provide visual representations of
datasets designed to help people carry out tasks more effectively.
They are suitable when there is a need to augment human capabilities
rather than replace people with computational decision-making methods.
Visualization usage can be analyzed in terms of why the user needs it,
what data is shown, and how the idiom is designed. I will discuss this
framework for analyzing the design of visualization systems.
