### cm006 2015-09-24 Thursday overview

  * Peer review closes today for [Homework 01](hw01_edit-README.html). TAs will then come through through your repos and comment. We send marks via email using the email you provided in the class survey.
  * [Homework 02](hw02_explore-gapminder-use-rmarkdown.html) due sometime next Tuesday 2015-09-29.
    - Explore the `gapminder` data.frame
    - Make some figures with `ggplot2`.
    - Practice writing R Markdown.
  * Today we'll handle the last mechanical bit: R Markdown.
    - By end of class, you'll have seen all the course mechanics: Git(Hub), (R) Markdown, HW submission, peer review, Discussion, etc.
    - Questions? Comments?
  * [Test drive R Markdown](block007_first-use-rmarkdown.html)
  * In class exercise:
    - Make a plot of [our enrollment data](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/924fe242a31e0239762f#file-2015_stat545_enrollment-csv) in and R Markdown document.
    - How to bring that into R?
        ``` r
        read.csv("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/924fe242a31e0239762f/raw/ea615f4a811a6e9e8a1fe95020a4407785181a21/2015_STAT545_enrollment.csv")
        ```
  * What's next?
    - Next week we'll move on to `dplyr` and understanding the different flavours of R objects

#### Slides and links

I've given two talks this year that discuss the importance of R Markdown in an analytical workflow and how nicely it plays with GitHub. We looked at *some* of these slides.

  * New tools and workflows for data analysis, Workshop on Visualization for Big Data: Strategies and Principles, Fields Institute, February 2015
    - GitHub repo with links and slides: [jennybc/2015-02-23_bryan-fields-talk](https://github.com/jennybc/2015-02-23_bryan-fields-talk)
    - Slides on [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/new-tools-and-workflows-for-data-analysis)
  * How R Markdown + Git + GitHub changed my (teaching?) life, R Summit, June 2015
    - GitHub repo with links and slides: [jennybc/2015-06-28_r-summit-talk](https://github.com/jennybc/2015-06-28_r-summit-talk)

#### Q and A from 2014

R Markdown is not the only way to get a pretty report. You can also get one from an __R script__.

  * When editing a `.R` file, RStudio offers a button for this is the spiral bound notebook icon, near where the "Knit HTML" button appears for `.Rmd`. Click and you get "Compile Notebook".
  * Under the hood, you are using a function called `spin()` from the `knitr` package.
  * Jenny's [`ggplot2` tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial) includes alot of Markdown that was made this way, i.e. from `.R` not `.Rmd`
    - look at source vs. rendered to get a feel for this
    - download the source and render yourself!
  * Basically, the special comment prefix `#'` becomes very important
  * R Markdown: prose is queen, R code is sequestered in special chunks
  * R script: code is queen, prose is sequestered in special comments
  * You can get virtually same HTML report either way. Which to choose? Depends whether the report is primary goal (choose `.Rmd`) or a by-product (choose `.R`).
  
I passed around hard copies of these 5 books (note: some links to eBooks and repositories are tuned to UBC users):

  * [R Graphics Cookbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023135.do) by Winston Chang, O'Reilly (2013). The [graphs section](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) of his [Cookbook for R website](http://www.cookbook-r.com) will give you a good sense of the book, which contains more material in greater detail.
