# dplyr functions for a single dataset



### Where were we?

In the [introduction to dplyr](block009_dplyr-intro.html), we used two very important verbs and an operator:

  * `filter()` for subsetting data with row logic
  * `select()` for subsetting data variable- or column-wise
  * the pipe operator `%>%`, which feeds the LHS as the first argument to the expression on the RHS
  
We also discussed dplyr's role inside the tidyverse and tibbles:

  * dplyr is a core package in the [tidyverse](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse) meta-package. Since we often make incidental usage of the others, we will load dplyr and the others via `library(tidyverse)`.
  * The tidyverse embraces a special flavor of data frame, called a tibble. The `gapminder` dataset is stored as a tibble.  

### Load dplyr and gapminder

I choose to load the tidyverse, which will load dplyr, among other packages we use incidentally below. Also load gapminder.


```r
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
```

```
## Loading tidyverse: ggplot2
## Loading tidyverse: tibble
## Loading tidyverse: tidyr
## Loading tidyverse: readr
## Loading tidyverse: purrr
## Loading tidyverse: dplyr
```

```
## Conflicts with tidy packages ----------------------------------------------
```

```
## filter(): dplyr, stats
## lag():    dplyr, stats
```

### Create a copy of gapminder

We're going to make changes to the `gapminder` tibble. To eliminate any fear that you're damaging the data that comes with the package, we create an explicit copy of `gapminder` for our experiments.


```r
(my_gap <- gapminder)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,704 × 6
##        country continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
##         <fctr>    <fctr> <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
## 1  Afghanistan      Asia  1952  28.801  8425333  779.4453
## 2  Afghanistan      Asia  1957  30.332  9240934  820.8530
## 3  Afghanistan      Asia  1962  31.997 10267083  853.1007
## 4  Afghanistan      Asia  1967  34.020 11537966  836.1971
## 5  Afghanistan      Asia  1972  36.088 13079460  739.9811
## 6  Afghanistan      Asia  1977  38.438 14880372  786.1134
## 7  Afghanistan      Asia  1982  39.854 12881816  978.0114
## 8  Afghanistan      Asia  1987  40.822 13867957  852.3959
## 9  Afghanistan      Asia  1992  41.674 16317921  649.3414
## 10 Afghanistan      Asia  1997  41.763 22227415  635.3414
## # ... with 1,694 more rows
```

**Pay close attention** to when we evaluate statements but let the output just print to screen:


```r
## let output print to screen, but do not store
my_gap %>% filter(country == "Canada")
```

... versus when we assign the output to an object, possibly overwriting an existing object.


```r
## store the output as an R object
my_precious <- my_gap %>% filter(country == "Canada")
```

### Use `mutate()` to add new variables

Imagine we wanted to recover each country's GDP. After all, the Gapminder data has a variable for population and GDP per capita. Let's multiply them together.

`mutate()` is a function that defines and inserts new variables into a tibble. You can refer to existing variables by name.


```r
my_gap %>%
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,704 × 7
##        country continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap         gdp
##         <fctr>    <fctr> <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>       <dbl>
## 1  Afghanistan      Asia  1952  28.801  8425333  779.4453  6567086330
## 2  Afghanistan      Asia  1957  30.332  9240934  820.8530  7585448670
## 3  Afghanistan      Asia  1962  31.997 10267083  853.1007  8758855797
## 4  Afghanistan      Asia  1967  34.020 11537966  836.1971  9648014150
## 5  Afghanistan      Asia  1972  36.088 13079460  739.9811  9678553274
## 6  Afghanistan      Asia  1977  38.438 14880372  786.1134 11697659231
## 7  Afghanistan      Asia  1982  39.854 12881816  978.0114 12598563401
## 8  Afghanistan      Asia  1987  40.822 13867957  852.3959 11820990309
## 9  Afghanistan      Asia  1992  41.674 16317921  649.3414 10595901589
## 10 Afghanistan      Asia  1997  41.763 22227415  635.3414 14121995875
## # ... with 1,694 more rows
```

Hmmmm ... those GDP numbers are almost uselessly large and abstract. Consider the [advice of Randall Munroe of xkcd](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/xkcd-randall-munroe-qanda-what-if/):

>One thing that bothers me is large numbers presented without context... 'If I added a zero to this number, would the sentence containing it mean something different to me?' If the answer is 'no,' maybe the number has no business being in the sentence in the first place."

Maybe it would be more meaningful to consumers of my tables and figures to stick with GDP per capita. But what if I reported GDP per capita, *relative to some benchmark country*. Since Canada is my adopted home, I'll go with that. 

I need to create a new variable that is `gdpPercap` divided by Canadian `gdpPercap`, taking care that I always divide two numbers that pertain to the same year.

How I achieve:

  * Filter down to the rows for Canada.
  * Create a new temporary variable in `my_gap`:
    - Extract the `gdpPercap` variable from the Canadian data.
    - Replicate it once per country in the dataset, so it has the right length.
  * Divide raw `gdpPercap` by this Canadian figure.
  * Discard the temporary variable of replicated Canadian `gdpPercap`.


```r
ctib <- my_gap %>%
  filter(country == "Canada")
## this is a semi-dangerous way to add this variable
## I'd prefer to join on year, but we haven't covered joins yet
my_gap <- my_gap %>%
  mutate(tmp = rep(ctib$gdpPercap, nlevels(country)),
         gdpPercapRel = gdpPercap / tmp,
         tmp = NULL)
```

Note that, `mutate()` builds new variables sequentially so you can reference earlier ones (like `tmp`) when defining later ones (like `gdpPercapRel`). Also, you can get rid of a variable by setting it to `NULL`.

How could we sanity check that this worked? The Canadian values for `gdpPercapRel` better all be 1!


```r
my_gap %>% 
  filter(country == "Canada") %>% 
  select(country, year, gdpPercapRel)
```

```
## # A tibble: 12 × 3
##    country  year gdpPercapRel
##     <fctr> <int>        <dbl>
## 1   Canada  1952            1
## 2   Canada  1957            1
## 3   Canada  1962            1
## 4   Canada  1967            1
## 5   Canada  1972            1
## 6   Canada  1977            1
## 7   Canada  1982            1
## 8   Canada  1987            1
## 9   Canada  1992            1
## 10  Canada  1997            1
## 11  Canada  2002            1
## 12  Canada  2007            1
```

I perceive Canada to be a "high GDP" country, so I predict that the distribution of `gdpPercapRel` is located below 1, possibly even well below. Check your intuition!


```r
summary(my_gap$gdpPercapRel)
```

```
##     Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max. 
## 0.007236 0.061650 0.171500 0.326700 0.446600 9.535000
```

The relative GDP per capita numbers are, in general, well below 1. We see that most of the countries covered by this dataset have substantially lower GDP per capita, relative to Canada, across the entire time period.

Remember: Trust No One. Including (especially?) yourself. Always try to find a way to check that you've done what meant to. Prepare to be horrified.

### Use `arrange()` to row-order data in a principled way

`arrange()` reorders the rows in a data frame. Imagine you wanted this data ordered by year then country, as opposed to by country then year.


```r
my_gap %>%
  arrange(year, country)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,704 × 7
##        country continent  year lifeExp      pop  gdpPercap gdpPercapRel
##         <fctr>    <fctr> <int>   <dbl>    <int>      <dbl>        <dbl>
## 1  Afghanistan      Asia  1952  28.801  8425333   779.4453   0.06856992
## 2      Albania    Europe  1952  55.230  1282697  1601.0561   0.14084925
## 3      Algeria    Africa  1952  43.077  9279525  2449.0082   0.21544589

## 5    Argentina  Americas  1952  62.485 17876956  5911.3151   0.52003442
## 6    Australia   Oceania  1952  69.120  8691212 10039.5956   0.88321046
## 7      Austria    Europe  1952  66.800  6927772  6137.0765   0.53989527
## 8      Bahrain      Asia  1952  50.939   120447  9867.0848   0.86803421
## 9   Bangladesh      Asia  1952  37.484 46886859   684.2442   0.06019482

## # ... with 1,694 more rows
```

Or maybe you want just the data from 2007, sorted on life expectancy?


```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(lifeExp)
```

```
## # A tibble: 142 × 7
##                     country continent  year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
##                      <fctr>    <fctr> <int>   <dbl>    <int>     <dbl>
## 1                 Swaziland    Africa  2007  39.613  1133066 4513.4806

```

Oh, you'd like to sort on life expectancy in **desc**ending order? Then use `desc()`.


```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))
```

```
## # A tibble: 142 × 7
##             country continent  year lifeExp       pop gdpPercap
##              <fctr>    <fctr> <int>   <dbl>     <int>     <dbl>
## 1             Japan      Asia  2007  82.603 127467972  31656.07

```

I advise that your analyses NEVER rely on rows or variables being in a specific order. But it's still true that human beings write the code and the interactive development process can be much nicer if you reorder the rows of your data as you go along. Also, once you are preparing tables for human eyeballs, it is imperative that you step up and take control of row order.

### Use `rename()` to rename variables

When I first cleaned this Gapminder excerpt, I was a [`camelCase`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase) person, but now I'm all about [`snake_case`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case). So I am vexed by the variable names I chose when I cleaned this data years ago. Let's rename some variables!


```r
my_gap %>%
  rename(life_exp = lifeExp,
         gdp_percap = gdpPercap,
         gdp_percap_rel = gdpPercapRel)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1,704 × 7
##        country continent  year life_exp      pop gdp_percap gdp_percap_rel
##         <fctr>    <fctr> <int>    <dbl>    <int>      <dbl>          <dbl>
## 1  Afghanistan      Asia  1952   28.801  8425333   779.4453     0.06856992
## 2  Afghanistan      Asia  1957   30.332  9240934   820.8530     0.06572108
## 3  Afghanistan      Asia  1962   31.997 10267083   853.1007     0.06336874
## 4  Afghanistan      Asia  1967   34.020 11537966   836.1971     0.05201335
## 5  Afghanistan      Asia  1972   36.088 13079460   739.9811     0.03900679
## 6  Afghanistan      Asia  1977   38.438 14880372   786.1134     0.03558542
## 7  Afghanistan      Asia  1982   39.854 12881816   978.0114     0.04271018
## 8  Afghanistan      Asia  1987   40.822 13867957   852.3959     0.03201305
## 9  Afghanistan      Asia  1992   41.674 16317921   649.3414     0.02464959
## 10 Afghanistan      Asia  1997   41.763 22227415   635.3414     0.02194243
## # ... with 1,694 more rows
```

I did NOT assign the post-rename object back to `my_gap` because that would make the chunks in this tutorial harder to copy/paste and run out of order. In real life, I would probably assign this back to `my_gap`, in a data preparation script, and proceed with the new variable names.

### `select()` can rename and reposition variables

You've seen simple use of `select()`. There are two tricks you might enjoy:

  1. `select()` can rename the variables you request to keep.
  1. `select()` can be used with `everything()` to hoist a variable up to the front of the tibble.
  

```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(country == "Burundi", year > 1996) %>% 
  select(yr = year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>% 
  select(gdpPercap, everything())
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 × 3
##   gdpPercap    yr lifeExp
##       <dbl> <int>   <dbl>
## 1  463.1151  1997  45.326
## 2  446.4035  2002  47.360
## 3  430.0707  2007  49.580
```

`everything()` is one of several helpers for variable selection. Read its help to see the rest.

### `group_by()` is a mighty weapon

I have found ~~friends and family~~ collaborators love to ask seemingly innocuous questions like, "which country experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in life expectancy?". In fact, that is a totally natural question to ask. But if you are using a language that doesn't know about data, it's an incredibly annoying question to answer.

dplyr offers powerful tools to solve this class of problem.

  * `group_by()` adds extra structure to your dataset -- grouping information -- which lays the groundwork for computations within the groups.
  * `summarize()` takes a dataset with $n$ observations, computes requested summaries, and returns a dataset with 1 observation.
  * Window functions take a dataset with $n$ observations and return a dataset with $n$ observations.
  * `mutate()` and `summarize()` will honor groups.
  * You can also do very general computations on your groups with `do()`, though elsewhere in this course, I advocate for other approaches that I find more intuitive, using the `purrr` package.
  
Combined with the verbs you already know, these new tools allow you to solve an extremely diverse set of problems with relative ease.

#### Counting things up

Let's start with simple counting.  How many observations do we have per continent?


```r
my_gap %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##   continent     n
##      <fctr> <int>
## 1    Africa   624
## 2  Americas   300
## 3      Asia   396
## 4    Europe   360
## 5   Oceania    24
```

Let us pause here to think about the tidyverse. You could get these same frequencies using `table()` from base R.


```r
table(gapminder$continent)
```

```
## 
##   Africa Americas     Asia   Europe  Oceania 
##      624      300      396      360       24
```

```r
str(table(gapminder$continent))
```

```
##  'table' int [1:5(1d)] 624 300 396 360 24
##  - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 1
##   ..$ : chr [1:5] "Africa" "Americas" "Asia" "Europe" ...
```

But the object of class `table` that is returned makes downstream computation a bit fiddlier than you'd like. For example, it's too bad the continent levels come back only as *names* and not as a proper factor, with the original set of levels. This is an example of how the tidyverse smooths transitions where you want the output of step i to become the input of step i + 1.

The `tally()` function is a convenience function that knows to count rows. It honors groups.


```r
my_gap %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  tally()
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##   continent     n
##      <fctr> <int>
## 1    Africa   624
## 2  Americas   300
## 3      Asia   396
## 4    Europe   360
## 5   Oceania    24
```

The `count()` function is an even more convenient function that does both grouping and counting.


```r
my_gap %>% 
  count(continent)
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##   continent     n
##      <fctr> <int>
## 1    Africa   624
## 2  Americas   300
## 3      Asia   396
## 4    Europe   360
## 5   Oceania    24
```

What if we wanted to add the number of unique countries for each continent? You can compute multiple summaries inside `summarize()`. Use the `n_distinct()` function to count the number of distinct countries within each continent.


```r
my_gap %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            n_countries = n_distinct(country))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 3
##   continent     n n_countries
##      <fctr> <int>       <int>
## 1    Africa   624          52

#### General summarization

The functions you'll apply within `summarize()` include classical statistical summaries, like  `mean()`, `median()`, `var()`, `sd()`, `mad()`, `IQR()`, `min()`, and `max()`. Remember they are functions that take $n$ inputs and distill them down into 1 output.

Although this may be statistically ill-advised, let's compute the average life expectancy by continent.


```r
my_gap %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(avg_lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##   continent avg_lifeExp
##      <fctr>       <dbl>
## 1    Africa    48.86533
## 2  Americas    64.65874
## 3      Asia    60.06490
## 4    Europe    71.90369
## 5   Oceania    74.32621
```

`summarize_each()` applies the same summary function(s) to multiple variables. Let's compute average and median life expectancy and GDP per capita by continent by year ... but only for 1952 and 2007.


```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(year %in% c(1952, 2007)) %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(mean, median), lifeExp, gdpPercap)
```

```

```

Let's focus just on Asia. What are the minimum and maximum life expectancies seen by year?


```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(min_lifeExp = min(lifeExp), max_lifeExp = max(lifeExp))
```

```
## # A tibble: 12 × 3
##     year min_lifeExp max_lifeExp
##    <int>       <dbl>       <dbl>
## 1   1952      28.801      65.390
## 2   1957      30.332      67.840
## 3   1962      31.997      69.390
## 4   1967      34.020      71.430
## 5   1972      36.088      73.420
## 6   1977      31.220      75.380
## 7   1982      39.854      77.110
## 8   1987      40.822      78.670
## 9   1992      41.674      79.360
## 10  1997      41.763      80.690
## 11  2002      42.129      82.000
## 12  2007      43.828      82.603
```

Of course it would be much more interesting to see *which* country contributed these extreme observations. Is the minimum (maximum) always coming from the same country? We tackle that with window functions shortly.

### Grouped mutate

Sometimes you don't want to collapse the $n$ rows for each group into one row. You want to keep your groups, but compute within them.

#### Computing with group-wise summaries

Let's make a new variable that is the years of life expectancy gained (lost) relative to 1952, for each individual country. We group by country and use `mutate()` to make a new variable. The `first()` function extracts the first value from a vector. Notice that `first()` is operating on the vector of life expectancies *within each country group*.


```r
my_gap %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% 
  mutate(lifeExp_gain = lifeExp - first(lifeExp)) %>% 
  filter(year < 1963)
```

```
## Source: local data frame [426 x 4]
## Groups: country [142]
## 
##        country  year lifeExp lifeExp_gain
##         <fctr> <int>   <dbl>        <dbl>
## 1  Afghanistan  1952  28.801        0.000
## 2  Afghanistan  1957  30.332        1.531
## 3  Afghanistan  1962  31.997        3.196
## 4      Albania  1952  55.230        0.000
## 5      Albania  1957  59.280        4.050
## 6      Albania  1962  64.820        9.590
## 7      Algeria  1952  43.077        0.000
## 8      Algeria  1957  45.685        2.608
## 9      Algeria  1962  48.303        5.226
## 10      Angola  1952  30.015        0.000
## # ... with 416 more rows
```

Within country, we take the difference between life expectancy in year $i$ and life expectancy in 1952. Therefore we always see zeroes for 1952 and, for most countries, a sequence of positive and increasing numbers.

#### Window functions

Window functions take $n$ inputs and give back $n$ outputs. Furthermore, the output depends on all the values. So `rank()` is a window function but `log()` is not. Here we use window functions based on ranks and offsets.

Let's revisit the worst and best life expectancies in Asia over time, but retaining info about *which* country contributes these extreme values.


```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(min_rank(desc(lifeExp)) < 2 | min_rank(lifeExp) < 2) %>% 
  arrange(year) %>%
  print(n = Inf)
```

```
## Source: local data frame [24 x 3]
## Groups: year [12]
## 
##     year     country lifeExp
##    <int>      <fctr>   <dbl>
## 1   1952 Afghanistan  28.801
## 2   1952      Israel  65.390
## 3   1957 Afghanistan  30.332
## 4   1957      Israel  67.840
## 5   1962 Afghanistan  31.997
## 6   1962      Israel  69.390
## 7   1967 Afghanistan  34.020
## 8   1967       Japan  71.430
## 9   1972 Afghanistan  36.088
## 10  1972       Japan  73.420
## 11  1977    Cambodia  31.220
## 12  1977       Japan  75.380
## 13  1982 Afghanistan  39.854
## 14  1982       Japan  77.110
## 15  1987 Afghanistan  40.822
## 16  1987       Japan  78.670
## 17  1992 Afghanistan  41.674
## 18  1992       Japan  79.360
## 19  1997 Afghanistan  41.763
## 20  1997       Japan  80.690
## 21  2002 Afghanistan  42.129
## 22  2002       Japan  82.000
## 23  2007 Afghanistan  43.828
## 24  2007       Japan  82.603
```

We see that (min = Afghanistan, max = Japan) is the most frequent result, but Cambodia and Israel pop up at least once each as the min or max, respectively. That table should make you impatient for our upcoming work on tidying and reshaping data! Wouldn't it be nice to have one row per year?

How did that actually work? First, I store and view a partial that leaves off the `filter()` statement. All of these operations should be familiar.


```r
asia <- my_gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(year)
asia
```

```
## Source: local data frame [396 x 3]
## Groups: year [12]
## 
##     year     country lifeExp
##    <int>      <fctr>   <dbl>
## 1   1952 Afghanistan  28.801
## 2   1957 Afghanistan  30.332
## 3   1962 Afghanistan  31.997
## 4   1967 Afghanistan  34.020
## 5   1972 Afghanistan  36.088
## 6   1977 Afghanistan  38.438
## 7   1982 Afghanistan  39.854
## 8   1987 Afghanistan  40.822
## 9   1992 Afghanistan  41.674
## 10  1997 Afghanistan  41.763
## # ... with 386 more rows
```

Now we apply a window function -- `min_rank()`. Since `asia` is grouped by year, `min_rank()` operates within mini-datasets, each for a specific year. Applied to the variable `lifeExp`, `min_rank()` returns the rank of each country's observed life expectancy. FYI, the `min` part just specifies how ties are broken. Here is an explicit peek at these within-year life expectancy ranks, in both the (default) ascending and descending order.

For concreteness, I use `mutate()` to actually create these variables, even though I dropped this in the solution above. Let's look at a bit of that.


```r
asia %>%
  mutate(le_rank = min_rank(lifeExp),
         le_desc_rank = min_rank(desc(lifeExp))) %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Afghanistan", "Japan", "Thailand"), year > 1995)
```

```
## Source: local data frame [9 x 5]
## Groups: year [3]
## 
##    year     country lifeExp le_rank le_desc_rank
##   <int>      <fctr>   <dbl>   <int>        <int>
## 1  1997 Afghanistan  41.763       1           33
## 2  2002 Afghanistan  42.129       1           33
## 3  2007 Afghanistan  43.828       1           33
## 4  1997       Japan  80.690      33            1
## 5  2002       Japan  82.000      33            1
## 6  2007       Japan  82.603      33            1
## 7  1997    Thailand  67.521      12           22
## 8  2002    Thailand  68.564      12           22
## 9  2007    Thailand  70.616      12           22
```

Afghanistan tends to present 1's in the `le_rank` variable, Japan tends to present 1's in the `le_desc_rank` variable and other countries, like Thailand, present less extreme ranks.

You can understand the original `filter()` statement now:


```r
filter(min_rank(desc(lifeExp)) < 2 | min_rank(lifeExp) < 2)
```

These two sets of ranks are formed on-the-fly, within year group, and `filter()` retains rows with rank less than 2, which means ... the row with rank = 1. Since we do for ascending and descending ranks, we get both the min and the max.

If we had wanted just the min OR the max, an alternative approach using `top_n()` would have worked.


```r
my_gap %>%
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  #top_n(1, wt = lifeExp)        ## gets the min
  top_n(1, wt = desc(lifeExp)) ## gets the max
```

```
## Source: local data frame [12 x 3]
## Groups: year [12]
## 
##     year     country lifeExp
##    <int>      <fctr>   <dbl>
## 1   1952 Afghanistan  28.801
## 2   1957 Afghanistan  30.332
## 3   1962 Afghanistan  31.997
## 4   1967 Afghanistan  34.020
## 5   1972 Afghanistan  36.088
## 6   1977    Cambodia  31.220
## 7   1982 Afghanistan  39.854
## 8   1987 Afghanistan  40.822
## 9   1992 Afghanistan  41.674
## 10  1997 Afghanistan  41.763
## 11  2002 Afghanistan  42.129
## 12  2007 Afghanistan  43.828
```

### Grand Finale

So let's answer that "simple" question: which country experienced the sharpest 5-year drop in life expectancy? Recall that this excerpt of the Gapminder data only has data every five years, e.g. for 1952, 1957, etc. So this really means looking at life expectancy changes between adjacent timepoints.

At this point, that's just too easy, so let's do it by continent while we're at it.


```r
my_gap %>%
  select(country, year, continent, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(continent, country) %>%
  ## within country, take (lifeExp in year i) - (lifeExp in year i - 1)
  ## positive means lifeExp went up, negative means it went down
  mutate(le_delta = lifeExp - lag(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ## within country, retain the worst lifeExp change = smallest or most negative
  summarize(worst_le_delta = min(le_delta, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ## within continent, retain the row with the lowest worst_le_delta
  top_n(-1, wt = worst_le_delta) %>% 
  arrange(worst_le_delta)
```

```
## Source: local data frame [5 x 3]
## Groups: continent [5]
## 
##   continent     country worst_le_delta
##      <fctr>      <fctr>          <dbl>
## 1    Africa      Rwanda        -20.421
## 2      Asia    Cambodia         -9.097
## 3  Americas El Salvador         -1.511
## 4    Europe  Montenegro         -1.464
## 5   Oceania   Australia          0.170
```

Ponder that for a while. The subject matter and the code. Mostly you're seeing what genocide looks like in dry statistics on average life expectancy.

Break the code into pieces, starting at the top, and inspect the intermediate results. That's certainly how I was able to *write* such a thing. These commands do not [leap fully formed out of anyone's forehead](http://tinyurl.com/athenaforehead) -- they are built up gradually, with lots of errors and refinements along the way. I'm not even sure it's a great idea to do so much manipulation in one fell swoop. Is the statement above really hard for you to read? If yes, then by all means break it into pieces and make some intermediate objects. Your code should be easy to write and read when you're done.

In later tutorials, we'll explore more of dplyr, such as operations based on two datasets.
