### Overview

This is an optional, non-marked homework that is nonetheless __highly recommended__. You can do some parts and ignore others.

Due anytime *?when ... depends on whether we coordinate peer review for those who opt in?*.

### Suggested activites

  * Idea #1: Clean up your `README.md`. When you're done, there will be two documents:
  
    - A proper `README` that introduces you to the class and holds a nice index (see below).
    
    - A separate HW01 document, in which you fool around with Markdown. You might want to extend it or create a companion to document key features of R Markdown.
  
  * Idea #2: Create a useful index into your homework. This mostly means annotating links with a description.
  
    - Useful to you in 6 months: "HW03: Manipulate and summarize the Gapminder data with `dplyr`; make companion figs with `ggplot2`"
    
    - Mysterious and frustrating: "HW03"
  
  * Idea #3: Give your repo some subdirectory structure and update all paths so your scripts still run and your R markdown still compiles. Rename files to enforce some global convention. Update the index to reflect all of this.
  
    - FYI I have a [new idea](https://gist.github.com/jennybc/362f52446fe1ebc4c49f) for easing the pain of rendering R Markdown documents that live in sub-directories of an RStudio Project. This is an alternative to manually changing your working directory.
    
  
  * Idea #4: Remake at least one figure from past homework, in light of something you learned in [cm012 2014-10-15 Wednesday](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/cm012_effective-graphs-and-practical-tips.html).
    
  * Idea #5: Identify some non-Gapminder data that interests you and might interest others. Get it ready for analysis (or get a handle on how difficult that will be). Feel free to team up with others for selection and cleaning -- in fact, I recommend it! See the [Discussion](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/39) thread for ideas.
